# Work Calendar/Scheduler

## Purpose
A website that provides the user with a quiz that is primarily made using JavaScript. When the user clicks the start button a timer starts and a series of questions are displayed that the user must answer.  A correct answer doesn't affect the countdown timer, while an incorrect answer will subtract 10 seconds from the timer.  When the user finishes the quiz, their remaining time is their score.  The user is able to save their score and initials to the page using localStorage.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS 
* Javascript

## Issues
* I cannot get the button to change to the desired color when you select a right or wrong answer.
* Have not been able to figure out how to prevent multiple clicks on the same answer.
* Have not been able save score with initials and add it to high score.
* Have not been able to utilize localStorage for this quiz.
