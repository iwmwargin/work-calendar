# Work Calendar/Scheduler

## Purpose
To provide the user with a scheduler that will help them keep track of tasks they need to accomplish.  It will also let them know if their task is in the past, present, or future, (by way of color) thanks to the use of Moment js. The user will be able to save and retrieve their tasks to the website using localStorage.

## Built With
* HTML (Boilerplate provided)
* CSS (Mostly provided)
* Javascript (Created by me)

## Issues
* None that I can see right now! *fingers-crossed*
